                    (2017). “Agent Based Modelling and Simulation tools: A review of thestate-of-art software”.
                    In:Computer Science Review 24, pp. 13–33.
                    provides a great foundation of state-of-the-art agent-based modelling and simulation tools.
                    At the time of writing, synthesis of ABMS might be outdated.
                    Therefore we will review and update the resources in addition to providing a few extra ABM tool
                    characteristics which are gaining traction.
